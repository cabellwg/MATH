This library is created by Daniel Sharp, an undergraduate at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). It was created as side project to
delve into the details of Numerical Linear Algebra using elementary graduate lev-
el algorithms such as QR Decomposition using Householder Reflections, the single 
shifted QR Eigenvalue algorithm, etc. Many functions (methods) are included that
primarily work for real matrices, though everything is stored as complex objects.
Many functions that primarily work for real matrices, however, can be used for
the complex analog, or at least at a rudimentary level. For example, the QR sing-
le shifted eigenvalue algorithm that is included is not intended for nonsymmetric
matrices, but can give rough approximations for their eigenvalues given small di-
mensions. This is not intended to be the best library, rather following the logic
a student could understand. Enjoy as need be.
