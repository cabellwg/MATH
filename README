     Matrix Algebra Toolset and Helper

	This library is created by Daniel Sharp, an undergraduate at Virginia Pol
ytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech). It was created as side
project to delve into the details of Numerical Linear Algebra using elementary
graduate level algorithms such as QR Decomposition using Householder Reflections,
the single shifted QR Eigenvalue algorithm, etc. Many functions (methods) are in-
cluded that primarily work for real matrices, though everything is stored as com-
plex objects.
	Many functions that primarily work for real matrices, however, can be
used for the complex analog, or at least at a rudimentary level. For example, the
QR single shifted eigenvalue algorithm that is included is not intended for nons-
ymmetric matrices, but can give rough approximations for their eigenvalues given 
small dimensions. This is not intended to be the best library, rather following
the logic a student could understand.
Enjoy as need be.
